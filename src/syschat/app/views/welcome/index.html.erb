      <h1>Welcome to Syschat</h1>
	  <h2>Beware, this is a work in progress, from here on anything can happen</h2>

Ideas for this page: 

users can log in with their email, password and nick. (Guess we need a register page too, and a change password page)<br/>
Nick defaults to previously used nick, but can be anything that is not yet in use (hmm... how to check 'in use') <br/>
email will be hidden to other users atleast by default. Might need a /whois command :)
