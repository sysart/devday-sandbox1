<h1>Welcome to Syschat</h1>
<h2>Beware, this is a work in progress, from here on anything can happen</h2>

Ideas for this page: 

users can log in with their email, password and nick. (Guess we need a register page too, and a change password page)<br/>
Nick defaults to previously used nick, but can be anything that is not yet in use (hmm... how to check 'in use') <br/>
email will be hidden to other users atleast by default. Might need a /whois command :)

<div>
      <% if current_user %>
        Signed in as <strong><%= current_user.name %></strong>!
        <%= link_to "Sign out", signout_path, id: "sign_out" %>
      <% else %>
        <%= link_to "Sign in with Google", "/auth/google_oauth2", id: "sign_in" %>
      <% end %>
    </div>
    <div>
    <%= yield %>
